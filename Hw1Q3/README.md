# MergeSort and InsertSort
Implementation of merge sort and insertion sort to sort an array/vector of integers implemented in python. Both programs read inputs from a file called “data.txt” where the first value of each line is the number of integers that need to be sorted, followed by the integers.

MergeSort.py  will output the sorted array into a text file named "merge.txt"
InsertSort.py will output the sorted array into a text file named "insert.txt"

# How to Run
Both programs work using Python 2.7.10
To run mergsort.py run the following command in your command line
```
python mergesort.py
```

To run insertsort.py run the following command in your command line
```
python insertsort.py
