# Premise
Acme Super Store is having a contest to give away shopping
sprees to lucky families. If a family wins a shopping spree each person in the family can take any items
in the store that he or she can carry out, however each person can only take one of each type of item.
For example, one family member can take one television, one watch and one toaster, while another
family member can take one television, one camera and one pair of shoes. Each item has a price (in
dollars) and a weight (in pounds) and each person in the family has a limit in the total weight they can
carry. Two people cannot work together to carry an item. Your job is to help the families select items
for each person to carry to maximize the total price of all items the family takes. Write an algorithm to
determine the maximum total price of items for each family and the items that each family member
should select. 

# How to Run
Shopping.py works using Python 2.7.10
It requires a file named shopping.txt that is supplied (please see file for formatting)
It will then output the test case number, the total price, and what items each family member should carry

To run shopping.py run the following command in your command line
```
python shopping.py
```
